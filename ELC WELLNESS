  <h1>ELC Wellness App – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>The ELC Wellness App is a wellbeing assistant designed for Empowered Living Choices (ELC) staff. It provides tools such as boundary scripts, stress resets, and reflection prompts.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use the app, it may collect basic text inputs you provide (e.g. “I feel stressed” or “family asked for extra hours”). If you use an Action (like Boundary Script Generator or Mood Check-In), the input you give (situation, tone, reflection notes) may be processed to return results.</p>

  <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>Inputs are used only to generate supportive responses in real time. If you choose to log moods or reflections, they are processed only for your use during that session. We do not sell or share your information with third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>By default, inputs stay within the ChatGPT system and are not stored permanently by ELC. If future updates allow logs or summaries to be stored, you will be notified, and storage will follow ELC data security policies. Sensitive information (like NDIS client details, medical conditions, or HR matters) should not be entered into the app.</p>

  <h2>4. External Services</h2>
  <p>Some Actions may connect to external services (e.g. timers, script libraries, or wellbeing resources). If this occurs, the service will only receive the information necessary to perform the action.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You may use the app anonymously (no personal data required). You may stop using the app at any time. If future updates allow data logs, you will have the right to view or request deletion of your entries.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about privacy or data use, contact Empowered Living Choices at [insert contact email/phone].</p>
